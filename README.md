Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
	For this project we were to complete work on an AI that should be able to find its way through a maze to retrieve a "treasure". We were given the code to setup the initial maze and control conditions for the game. We were tasked with creating the logic that dictated how the pirate would explore and learn the maze. I specifically created a way for the system to choose a starting space from the spaces designated as free, along with a way for the AI to choose how it moves through the maze. Should a user wish they can change the epsilon value so the AI chooses random paths more or less. Finally, I created the condition at the end that determines if a game has been won or lost. This indicator is saved to a list that is then used to calculate the overall win rate for the AI. 

 
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
	Computer scientists are developers and researchers of future computer technology. Usually this has a basis in coding or software development, but this can also bleed into systems like AI. These scientists help to pioneer the next stages of technology, and with how it stands right now, they will create an AI that will be able to comprehend human language perfectly along with solving problems that take us weeks or even months to accomplish. Without computer scientists some of todays computers and phones wouldn't be able to do nearly as much as they do today.
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
	If you want to go about something like a computer scientist you'll want to start with the basics. Every problem can be split up into smaller issues that can be tackled one piece at a time. You'll want to also consider wider variables like who will be using your solution, how often will someone be expected to operate it, and how complicated is your solution to carry out. Depending on the problem you want to tackle you may need to consider visual aspects or auditory ques. Overall, you'll want to look at your problem in as wide a scope as you can so that you can narrow in on issues that are more easily solved. As you knock out smaller issues larger ones can become easier to grasp. 
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
